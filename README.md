# India_Elections_Result_Analysis

This project analyzes the 2024 Indian General Election results using SQL. It involves data cleaning, transformation, and in-depth querying to extract meaningful insights such as party-wise performance, voter turnout trends, state-wise seat distribution, and more. The goal is to showcase how SQL can be leveraged for large-scale electoral data analysis

Tools Used - Excel, Data Cleaning, ETL, SQL

I learned Advanced SQL Techniques: Improved my skills in using CTEs, JOINs, CASE WHEN, window functions, and aggregate queries to manipulate and analyze large datasets.

Data Cleaning: Gained hands-on experience in cleaning and transforming messy real-world data into structured formats suitable for analysis.

Electoral Data Analysis: Understood the structure of election data including constituencies, party-wise votes, voter turnout, and margins of victory.

Insight Communication: Learned how to structure queries that answer real-world political questions and generate actionable insights.

 Insights from the Analysis: Identified the leading political parties based on total seats won and vote share. Observed regional variations in voter turnout and party dominance across different states. Highlighted constituencies where the winning margin was less than 1%, revealing highly competitive races. Found states with exceptionally high or low voter participation, hinting at regional engagement disparities.
